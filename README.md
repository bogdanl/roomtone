# Room Tone - Movie Ratings Aggregator

Room Tone is a Next.js application that retrieves movie ratings from several platforms including:
* IMDb
* Rotten Tomatoes
* Metacritic
* Letterboxd
* Mubi

Movie addicts might know the hassle of having to look up a movie on various platforms to find its ratings, before deciding whether it's worth their time â€“ this is the reason why I made this app: to save time to said cinephiles. I don't watch trailers, I don't watch teasers, I don't read plots (besides vague keywords), so contextualized ratings are my compass.

## Features

- **Multi-Platform Ratings:** Retrieve and display movie ratings from multiple platforms.
- **Dynamic API Calls:** Uses SWR-based data fetching to provide real-time ratings.
- **Easy UI:** Display movie details, poster, ratings and links to the various platforms for more details.

## Getting Started
